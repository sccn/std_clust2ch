std_clust2ch is a plugin for EEGLAB STUDY developed by Makoto Miyakoshi. It is a tool for performing cluster-level IC selection/rejection. For example, one can compute Fz ERP using the selected IC cluster. Thus std_clust2ch can be used as a cluster-level IC rejection. For example, one creates IC clusters using power spectral density (PSD) only, then evaluate the PSD of each cluster, then finally determine which cluster to reject. This is probably the most efficient manual IC rejection method available using EEGLAB, and I have been using this approach until Luca developed ICLabel().
